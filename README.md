# StockLearner
Deep learning for China A share stock data

Purpose:
User machine learning to perdict stock price

Requirements:

Supervised learning:
- tensorflow >= 1.8.0
- pandas >= 0.23.2
- numpy >= 0.23.2

Reinforcement learning:
- all in supervised learning
- backtrader >= 1.9.59.122

Usage:
1. Modify app.config to set the training data path, eval data path and model config path
2. Create or modify your own model config ini file and put it into the model config path
3. Run sl_ops.py for supervised learning and run rl_ops for reinforcement learning

Models:
So far MLP and RNN(LSTM) only

Data:
Please use CSV file with columns as below:
"DATE", "OPEN", "HIGH", "CLOSE", "LOW", "VOLUME", "PRICE_CHANGE", "P_CHANGE", "TURNOVER", "LABEL"
*Date will be removed during training
or you can modify /feed/csv_data.py to support your own columns

Known issue:
Multiprocessing has issues, so only place one model config file and train one time. This will be fixed in future

TODO:
0. Will add batch normalization in MLP soon
1. Create new config folder for config classesï¼Œrename current config folder to config_file and only store for .ini files
2. Extract train and predict ops from model classes, create new train_ops for them
3. Refactor for DQN
   3.1 Create config class for DQN
   3.2 Add double Q learning
   3.3 Add Duel DQN
   3.4 Add Prioritized Replay Buffer
   3.5 Add Tenorboard summary
   3.6 Add learning rate ops
4. Create A3C for deep reinforcement learning
5. Use eager execution to support TensorFlow2.0 in future
